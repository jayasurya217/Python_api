# Python_api
Here I had used SQLAlchemy to access the database, and also used Marshmallow to serialize and deserialize the data managed by REST API. 
Steps:
  1. Used SQLAlchemy to create database.
  2. created a html file as an user interface
  3. Install Flask-SQLAlchemy, marshmallow and marshmallow-sqlalchemy.
  4. create the database using build_db.py
  5. Run the server.py
  6. Get the url
  7. Perform the operation (CURD)
